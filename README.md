*Full-stack blockchain engineer — building calm, predictable systems*

I work across the full arc of a protocol:
designing its contracts, shaping its data, and giving it an interface that feels inevitable.
Most days are spent refining invariants, tightening backend flows,
and stitching together multi-chain logic without drama.

AMMs, lending paths, staking, token systems, cross-chain execution —
each built with the same intention: **clarity over noise, stability over flair.**
